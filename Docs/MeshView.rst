MeshView
=========

MeshView is a web application for real-time 3D display of surface mesh data representing structural parcellations from volumetric atlases, such as the Waxholm Space Atlas of the Sprague Dawley Rat Brain.

As in the previous cases you will access the app from the project page or through the tab on top of your main page.
