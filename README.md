# LocaliView
Pipeline for rodent brain section images annotation and registration to reference 3D atlases.

LocaliView allows users to perform atlas registration of their rodent brain section images and annotate objects for extraction as point clouds visualised in a 3D atlas viewer.

The workflow comprises a suite of tools designed to support atlas-based analyses of series of histological images from mouse or rat brain.

- CreateZoom (transformation of 2D images into pyramid format DZIP)
- WebAlign (Semi-automated Linear Atlas-Registration)
- WebWarp (Nonlinear Refinement of Atlas-Registration)
- LocaliZoom (Serial section image viewer with annotation tool)
- MeshView (3D brain atlas viewerwith solid slicing and point cloud support)
